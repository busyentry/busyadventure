How to run this example:

1) checkout everything (this might take a few minutes as the testing sample data is about 65 MB)
	
	git clone https://github.com/busyentry/busyadventure.git
	
2) run the jar file (this will take a few minutes as well for the program to process all the text and zip files)

	java -jar wordcount.jar data/in data/out/myresult.txt
	
3) verify the output file is under

	data/out
